# My Coding Journey Project

## Project Context
This is a learning project for mastering web development fundamentals and AI collaboration. Currently building interactive web applications while learning JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and professional development workflows.

## Current Focus
- Building interactive web applications
- Learning JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Establishing AI collaboration workflows
- Creating portfolio projects

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `taskList` not `tl`)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Always handle edge cases and errors
